When you setup a brain account you get a trial of all Cloud Services for 30 days for unlimited private syncing from TheBrain desktop application and your mobile brains to TheBrain Cloud. You have the option to publish your brain publicly or privately online.
By default, your brain is local and not synced to the cloud. Click the cloud icon and confirm that you want to upload your brain to get started.
After 30 days if you decide to stick with the Free Edition, you can continue to sync and use cloud services but you will not be able to sync added file attachments to your brain or use other Pro Services.
What types of attachments are supported?
All URL attachments are synchronized by both the Free and Pro Cloud Services. Internal attachments including all file types and folders are synchronized with Pro Services.

What happens to my existing published brain after my Pro Services trial?
After your trial ends you will still have access to all data that you synced to the cloud.
If you want to continue to publish with additional file attachments you will need to subscribe to TheBrain Pro Services.
